<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

A library for accessing and analyzing Pickleball data from
[pklmart](https://github.com/aspancake/pklmart). You can find the full
documentation [here](https://nolan-smyth.com/pklshop/).

## Install

Install using:

``` sh
pip install pklshop
```

## How to use

This package includes the latest pickleball data from pklmart already
convieniently loaded into a pandas dataframe. You can access this data
by importing the `pklshop.data` module using:

``` python
from pklshop.data import *
```

(Note that since this package is writen using
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) it is safe to wildcard import because
the `__all__` variable is automatically generated for each module.)

Available tables are:

``` python
table_names
```

    ['tournament',
     'match',
     'game',
     'rally',
     'shot_type_ref',
     'shot',
     'player',
     'team']

``` python
g = Game("G1")
g.summarize_game()
```

    Anna Leigh Waters & Leigh Waters beat Jesse Irvine & Catherine Parenteau 12-10 in game G1
                 Player  Error %  Winner %
